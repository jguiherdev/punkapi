# Punk Beer App

Welcome to the "Punk Beer App" repository! This app is built with React and powered by Vite.

Primary Requirements:

**The requirements for this test were as follows:**

✔️ 1. JavaScript must be used, and you can use any framework or library you see fit. The use of React is an asset.

✔️ 2. The application must be mobile friendly.

✔️ 3. The main/start view should show a list of cards with the available beers.

✔️ 4. By default, each card should show name, image, and the tag line of the beer. And when clicked, the full profile should be displayed.

✔️ 5. The application must have a search box where you can select to search by the following criteria:

By foods that go well with beers. Examples: “Chicken” => “Buzz”, “Russian Doll – India Pale Ale”

By the name or part of the name of the beer. Examples: “lager” => “Pilsen Lager”, “77 Lager”

✔️ 6. The results of both the home page listing and searches should be paginated a maximum of 10 cards per page.

✔️ 7. The code may be delivered in a zipped file containing all the necessary files or a link to a repository of the candidate.

✔️ 8. A document with the instructions for its execution should be included. In addition, include some comments on how you decided on the 
architecture/structure of the application, the choice of framework/library used, and what improvements you would propose to the client.

✔️ 9. The code and documentation must be in English.

Optional Features:

✔️ 10. Functionality for the user to bookmark and filter by favorites. As no database is used, browser localStorage can be used.

❌ 11. A button where you can select the properties to be displayed in the card view and where you can add new ones e.g. ABV, IBU, First Brewed.

❌ 12. A button that can switch from card view to table view and vice versa.
